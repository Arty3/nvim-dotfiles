## üìù Overview

#### THIS IS STILL WIP

After using vscode all my life, I decided it's finally time to move to neovim.
This is my setup and configuration for Windows using [neovide](https://neovide.dev/), which gives me a much nicer experience on native Windows. When I get around to it, I will make this automatically hotswap to a linux config depending on the OS.
